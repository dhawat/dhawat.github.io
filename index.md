<center> <h1>About </h1> </center>

I am currently a PhD student at the [CRIStAL](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/) laboratory in the [SigMA](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?rubrique27&eid=30) team in Lille, and at the [MAP5](https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) laboratory in the probability team in Paris.\
I'm working on the subject: "stochastic methods for numerical integrations", under the supervision of Rémi BARDENET and  Raphael LACHIEZE-REY.\
I'm also [winner](https://briques2math.home.blog/2021/10/26/diala-mariem-et-mehdi-evaluation-automatique-de-la-qualite-de-donnees/) of the [challenge mathématiques et entreprise](https://challenge-maths.sciencesconf.org/), organized by [AMIES](https://www.agence-maths-entreprises.fr/public/pages/index.html). We worked for the company [Foyer](https://www.foyer.lu/en/homepage) our aim was to improve data quality ([interview](https://youtu.be/3IV06PqZ85s?t=403)).\
I was [PGSM laureates](https://applications.sciencesmaths-paris.fr/fr/les-laureats-du-programme-pgsm-master-850.htm) during 2019/2020 for my master 2
"Mathématiques et Applications" of the University Paris.

    In condensed matter physics, it has been observed for some particle systems that, the variance of the number of points in a large window is lower than expected, a phenomenon called hyperuniformity.
    There are many candidate hyperunifrom point processes (HU) in the physics literature, but rigorously proving that a point process is HU is usually difficult. It is thus desirable to have standardized numerical tests of hyperunifomity. Common practice in statistical physics is to estimate a spectral measure called the structure factor, the behavior of which around zero is a sign of hyperuniformity.
    We survey existing estimators of the structure factor and gather them all in the Python toolbox [structure_factor](https://github.com/For-a-few-DPPs-more/structure-factor).
    Moreover, [structure_factor](https://github.com/For-a-few-DPPs-more/structure-factor) contains a test for testing the effective hyperunifomity of a given point process and the possible class of hyperuniformity.
    The documentation of the Package is published via the GitHub workflow file ([here](https://for-a-few-dpps-more.github.io/structure-factor/)). Furthermore, a [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/For-a-few-DPPs-more/structure-factor/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial_structure_factor.ipynb) containing a detailed example of the methods of [structure_factor](https://github.com/For-a-few-DPPs-more/structure-factor) applied on a realization from the Ginibre ensemble is [available](https://github.com/For-a-few-DPPs-more/structure-factor/blob/main/notebooks/tutorial_structure_factor.ipynb).
